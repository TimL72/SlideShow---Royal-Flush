# An attempt at a slideshow

- Obviously, I have no clue what I'm doing.

- So far, I made a few .rst files, added some text, and figured out how to link a few images.

- I'm guessing that I need to add a bunch of formatting next, instead of just plain text.

- But at least I am getting some practice with GitHub ...
